## Part 1: High-Level Architecture Design

See the [Figma Diagram](https://www.figma.com/board/77tO7NRcYo8azEseWuHhpI/Content-Analytics?node-id=26-2198&t=ao9I2QNvKoG4aGy0-1) and [architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for more details.

## Part 2: Implementation

I chose to implement the storage component of the system as it contained the most unique aspects to the challenges domain and allowed for experimentation in parquet which would give me more insights into the potential ML ready operations which could be performed on the data.

See the [implementation.md](docs/implementation.md) for more details.

## Dev Setup

See the [dev_setup.md](docs/dev_setup.md) for more details.
